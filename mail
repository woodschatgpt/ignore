I am currently focused on improving test coverage for the codebase. Present coverage is at 57%. I've added test cases, but these have not yet increased the overall coverage, likely because they target parts of the code that were already covered, or are not exercising previously uncovered lines/branches.
I'm continuing to analyze uncovered code paths and am working on adding more targeted tests to improve the coverage further. Will provide another update as coverage increases.
