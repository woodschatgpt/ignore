Subject: Monthly Revalidation Workflow – Detailed Plan Document

Hi Pradeep,

As discussed, please find attached the detailed workflow document describing our proposed approach for the Monthly Revalidation feature in the Outlier Detector pipeline.

This document includes:

Background and purpose of the revalidation job
Step-by-step workflow description
Sample data illustrating the comparison logic
Expected output format with REVALIDATION_STATUS handling (updated, missing, new)
Benefits and next steps for implementation
The goal of this revalidation process is to ensure our outlier data remains fully in sync with the latest positions/transaction recalculations, while preserving client annotations and maintaining a clear audit trail of all changes.

Please review the attached document at your convenience. Let me know if you’d like to discuss any part of it further or if there are any suggested adjustments.

Happy to walk through it in detail if needed.

Thanks and regards,
Navya
